### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
<!--
**ucezema/ucezema** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- âœ¨ I'm interested in public health informatics, and digital health in general
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript for full-stack/app development
- ğŸ”­ I currently work in a health agency where I develop electronic data collection tools to improve the quality immunization and disease surveillance data
- ğŸ”­ In my early digital health journey, I wish to build a highly interactive, dynamic and functional website for my agency, to help organize, manage, and share relevant information - with staff and colleagues, and with the public. I am currently working on this project and I document my progress in the **ucezema/agency** repository.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on building an interative data analytic dashboard with JavaScript and R, where specific health program data are fed, with features that flag quality issues, real-time.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with optimized use of Git
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about e-Surveys, XLSForms (ODK, Kobo), public health.
