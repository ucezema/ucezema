### Hi there 👋
- ✨ I'm interested in public health informatics, and digital health in general
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript for full-stack/app development
- 🔭 I currently work in a health agency where I develop electronic data collection tools to improve the quality immunization and disease surveillance data
- 🔭 In my early digital health journey, I wish to build a highly interactive, dynamic and functional website for my agency, to help organize, manage, and share relevant information - with staff and colleagues, and with the public. I am currently working on this project and I document my progress in the **ucezema/agency** repository.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on building an interative data analytic dashboard with JavaScript and R, where specific health program data are fed, with features that flag quality issues, real-time.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with optimized use of Git
- 💬 Ask me about e-Surveys, XLSForms (ODK, Kobo), public health.
